Why should someone use this package?
Spatial statistics is a complex topic and "Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data" by Cressie and Wikle could be taken as a guide through this field. However, understanding the book is hard. This package is an attempt to help readers by providing R scripts which run the examples and figures in the book. In this way, the equations become functions which hopefully are easier to understand, at least for programmers.

How does it compare to other existing solutions?
No idea

What are the main functions?
None so far
